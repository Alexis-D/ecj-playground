Just a playground for me to play with [ECJ](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/) (Evolutionary Computation in Java).

This is configured in a way that next to the `ecj-playground/` directory there is an `ecj/` directory which contains a clone of the ECJ main repo (hosted @ Google code).

It should work without this, but then you'll have to change the paths to simple.params & de.params.
